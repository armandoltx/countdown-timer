# Introduction

As a part of my training in JavaScript to improve mi skills, I decide to rite code everyday and publish it on GitHub.

Today I am uploading a count down timer. It is imoportant to take a break every hour, so with this application you are able to track the time you are in front of the screen, that does not mean you are working...

## Goals

- Create an countdown uswing pure VanillaJS.
- Learn how to use setInterval and clearInterval functions.
- Improve my programming skills using CSS, HTML and JavaScript in the application.
- Build an application that I can reuse.

## Approach

Working with seconds is kind of complicated, due you have to be carefull when using zeros.
So, at first I just had the JavaScript working and after that I added some features, such as, changing the colour, adding different messages and the final alert message.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
